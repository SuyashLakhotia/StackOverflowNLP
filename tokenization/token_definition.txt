- Each punctuation mark is a separate token (some exceptions: '...', '->', clitics, text emojis, 'e.g.', 'C#', 'C++')
- A URL is a single separate token
- A code block is a single separate token (from '<code>' to '</code>')
- Clitics are a separate token from the word
- A word (with no punctuation / space in between) is a separate token
