Token Definition:

- Each punctuation mark is a separate token (some exceptions: '...', '->', clitics, text emojis, 'e.g.', 'i.e.', 'C#', 'C++', '.NET', '1.x', '2.x', decimal numbers, URLs, package names)
- Each text emoji is a token.
- Each programming language is a separate token. 
- A URL is a single separate token (Both partial and complete URLs are considered such as 'java.net' or 'http://asm.objectweb.org/')
- Java package names are considered as one token (For example, 'com.foo.Bar.class' is considered as 1 token)
- A code block is a single separate token (from '<code>' to '</code>')
- Clitics are a separate token from the word
- A word (with no punctuation / space in between) is a separate token
